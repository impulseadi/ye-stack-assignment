# Blog Post Application

This is a simple blog post application built using **React**, **React Router**, and **Local Storage**. Users can search for blog posts, add new posts, and view them in a list. The application fetches posts from a public API and allows users to add their own posts, which are saved in **localStorage**.

## Features

- **View Posts**: Display posts fetched from a public API (`https://dummyjson.com/posts`).
- **Search Posts**: Search for posts by title.
- **Add New Post**: Add new posts that are saved to `localStorage`.
- **Post Details**: Each post can be clicked to view details on a separate page.
- **Clear Local Storage**: Option to clear added posts.
